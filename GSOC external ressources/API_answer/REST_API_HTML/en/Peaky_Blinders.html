The group, which grew out of the harsh economic deprivations of working-class Britain, consisted largely of young criminals from lower- to middle-class backgrounds. They engaged in robbery, violence, racketeering, illegal bookmaking, and control of gambling. Members wore signature outfits that typically included tailored jackets, lapelled overcoats, buttoned waistcoats, silk scarves, bell-bottom trousers, leather boots, and peaked flat caps.","extract_html":"<p>The <b>Peaky Blinders</b> were a street gang based in Birmingham, England, which operated from the 1880s until the 1910s.
