It borders on the Atlantic Ocean and Gulf of Maine to the east, Connecticut and Rhode Island to the south, New Hampshire and Vermont to the north and New York to the west. The capital of Massachusetts is Boston, which is the most populous city in New England. It is home to the Greater Boston metropolitan area, which is known for being rich with American history, academia, and industry. Originally, the local economy was dependent on agriculture, fishing and trade. However, Massachusetts was transformed into a manufacturing center during the Industrial Revolution.
