These lesions may lead to narrowing due to the buildup of atheromatous plaque. At onset there are usually no symptoms, but if they develop, symptoms generally begin around middle age. When severe, it can result in coronary artery disease, stroke, peripheral artery disease, or kidney problems, depending on which arteries are affected.","extract_html":"<p><b>Atherosclerosis</b> is a pattern of the disease arteriosclerosis in which the wall of the artery develops abnormalities, called lesions.
