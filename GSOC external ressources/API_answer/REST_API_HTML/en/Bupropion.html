It is also popular as an add-on medication in the cases of \"incomplete response\" to the first-line selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) antidepressant. Bupropion has several features that distinguish it from other antidepressants: it does not usually cause sexual dysfunction; it is not associated with weight gain and sleepiness, and it is more effective than SSRIs at improving symptoms of hypersomnia and fatigue. Bupropion does, however, carry a much higher risk of seizure than many other antidepressants and extreme caution must be taken in patients with a history of seizure disorder.","extract_html":"<p><b>Bupropion</b>, sold under the brand names <b>Wellbutrin</b> and <b>Zyban</b> among others, is an atypical antidepressant primarily used to treat major depressive disorder and to support smoking cessation.
