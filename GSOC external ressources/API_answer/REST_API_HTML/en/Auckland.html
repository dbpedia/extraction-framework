The most populous urban area in the country and the fifth largest city in Oceania, Auckland has an urban population of about 1,463,000. It is located in the greater Auckland Region—the area governed by Auckland Council—which includes outlying rural areas and the islands of the Hauraki Gulf, and which has a total population of 1,715,600. While Europeans continue to make up the plurality of Auckland's population, the city became multicultural and cosmopolitan in the late-20th century, with Asians accounting for 31% of the city's population in 2018. With its large population of Pasifika New Zealanders, Auckland is also home to the biggest ethnic Polynesian population in the world. The Māori-language name for Auckland is Tāmaki Makaurau, meaning \"Tāmaki desired by many\", in reference to the desirability of its natural resources and geography.","extract_html":"<p><b>Auckland</b> is a large metropolitan city in the North Island of New Zealand.
