That process is also called analysis. An example application would be decomposing the waveform of a musical chord into terms of the intensity of its constituent pitches. The term Fourier transform refers to both the frequency domain representation and the mathematical operation that associates the frequency domain representation to a function of space or time.","extract_html":"<p>A <b>Fourier transform</b> (<b>FT</b>) is a mathematical transform that decomposes functions depending on space or time into functions depending on spatial frequency or temporal frequency.
