He is traditionally counted as the first bishop of Rome‍—‌or pope‍—‌and also as the first bishop of Antioch. Based on contemporary historical data, his papacy is estimated to have spanned from AD 30 to his death, which would make him the longest-reigning pope, at anywhere from 34 to 38 years; however, the length of his reign has never been verified.","extract_html":"<p><b>Saint Peter</b>, also known as <b>Peter the Apostle</b>, <b>Peter the Rock</b>, <b>Simon Peter</b>, <b>Simeon</b>, <b>Simon</b>, or <b>Cephas</b>, was one of the Twelve Apostles of Jesus Christ, and one of the first leaders of the early Church.
