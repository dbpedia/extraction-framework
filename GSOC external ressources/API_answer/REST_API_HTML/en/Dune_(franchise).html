Dune is frequently described as the best selling science fiction novel in history. It won the inaugural Nebula Award for Best Novel and the Hugo Award in 1966, and was later adapted into a 1984 film, a 2000 television miniseries, and a 2021 film. Herbert wrote five sequels, the first two of which were adapted as a miniseries called Frank Herbert's Children of Dune in 2003. Dune has also inspired some traditional games and a series of video games. Since 2009, the names of planets from the Dune novels have been adopted for the real-world nomenclature of plains and other features on Saturn's moon Titan.","extract_html":"<p><i><b>Dune</b></i>, also known as the <i><b>Dune Chronicles</b></i>, is an American science fiction media franchise that originated with the 1965 novel <i>Dune</i> by Frank Herbert and has continued to add new publications. <i>Dune</i> is frequently described as the best selling science fiction novel in history.
