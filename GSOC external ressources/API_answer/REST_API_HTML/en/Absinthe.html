Historically described as a highly alcoholic spirit, it is 45–74% ABV or 90–148 proof US. Absinthe traditionally has a natural green color but may also be colorless. It is commonly referred to in historical literature as la fée verte. It is sometimes mistakenly referred to as a liqueur, but is not traditionally bottled with added sugar and is, therefore, classified as a spirit. Absinthe is traditionally bottled at a high level of alcohol by volume, but it is normally diluted with water before being consumed.","extract_html":"<p><b>Absinthe</b> is an anise-flavoured spirit derived from several plants, including the flowers and leaves of <i>Artemisia absinthium</i>, together with green anise, sweet fennel, and other medicinal and culinary herbs.
