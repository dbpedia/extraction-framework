By far the greatest species diversity is in eastern Asia, notably China, Korea, and Japan. Most are shrubs 1–3 m tall, but some are small trees, and others lianas reaching up to 30 m (100 ft) by climbing up trees. They can be either deciduous or evergreen, though the widely cultivated temperate species are all deciduous.","extract_html":"<p><i><b>Hydrangea</b></i>, common names <b>hydrangea</b> or <b>hortensia</b>, is a genus of over 75 species of flowering plants native to Asia and the Americas.
