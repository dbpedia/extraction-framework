This is an extension to MediaWiki to provide an OAI-PMH repository
interface by which page updates can be snarfed in a relatively sane fashion
to a mirror site.

OAI-PMH protocol specs:
http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/openarchivesprotocol.html

A harvester script forms the client half. Apply oaiharvest_table.sql to
clients to allow saving a checkpointing record; this ensures consistent
update ordering.


At the moment this script is quite experimental; it may not implement the
whole spec yet, and hooks for actually updating may not be complete.

The extension adds an 'updates' table which associates last-edit timestamps
with cur_id values. A separate table is used so it can also hold entries for
cur rows which have been deleted, allowing this to be explicitly mentioned
to a harvester even if it comes back after quite a while.

Clients will get only the latest current update; this does not include
complete old page entries by design, as basic mirrors generally don't need
to maintain that extra stuff.


As of May 19, the updater will attempt to update the links tables on edits,
and can fetch uploaded image files automatically.

(Uploads must be enabled locally with $wgEnableUploads = true; or no files
will be fetched. image table records will be updated either way.)
