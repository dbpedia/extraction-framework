'''[[Afghanistan]] Police Program''' is an [[US]]-funded program, designed to train and equip part of the [[Afghan National Police]] (ANP). <ref>[http://oig.state.gov/documents/organization/76103.pdf Interagency Assessment of Afghanistan Police Training and Readiness (PDF)]</ref>

==Overview==
At a Geneva conference on Afghanistan security in April [[2002]], the [[United States]] and other donor countries agreed to support the rebuilding of the security forces in post-Taliban Afghanistan. They established a “five pillars” approach, each to be led by a different nation. The United States took the lead to build the [[Afghan National Army]] (ANA). [[Germany]] took the lead for the police sector.<ref> D+C article 11/2010: The German Police Project Team in Afghanistan [http://www.inwent.org/ez/articles/182761/index.en.shtml]</ref> The other pillars are the justice system ([[Italy]]), counternarcotics ([[United Kingdom|Britain]]), and disarmament of illegal armed groups ([[Japan]]).

The program calls for building the Afghan National Police by requiring a comprehensive, integrated approach that encompasses leadership training, sustaining institutions and organizations, and oversight and internal control mechanisms. It has rapidly evolved beyond police readiness requirements and training to include sweeping institutional reform of the ANP through the Ministry of Interior.

===Program goals===
The intended end state of the U.S.-funded ANP is an effective, well-organized, professional, multiethnic national police force that is trained and equipped to provide a safe and secure environment for the people of Afghanistan and a force committed to the rule of law. The ANP need to be led well, paid decent salaries, and trained and equipped to carry out their assigned security and law and order missions. The program’s goal is to establish a self sustaining
ANP – a police force able to attract and retain qualified candidates and to operate with minimal international assistance.
