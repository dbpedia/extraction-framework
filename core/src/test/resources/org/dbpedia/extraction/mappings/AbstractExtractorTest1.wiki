[[Apple]]s appear in many [[World religions|religious traditions]], often as a mystical or [[forbidden fruit]]. One of the problems identifying apples in [[religion]], [[mythology]] and [[folktales]] is that as late as the 17th century, the word "apple" was used as a generic term for all (foreign) fruit other than berries, but including nuts.<ref>"apple." Online Etymology Dictionary. Douglas Harper, Historian. 25 May. 2011. http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/apple</ref> This term may even have extended to plant [[gall]]s, as they were thought to be of plant origin.  For instance, when [[tomato]]es were introduced into Europe, they were called "love apples".  In one Old English work, [[cucumber]]s are called ''eorþæppla'' (lit. "earth-apples'), just as in [[French language|French]], [[Dutch language|Dutch]] and [[Swiss German]], the words for [[potato]]es mean "earth-apples" in English.  In some languages, [[orange (fruit)|orange]]s are called "golden apples" or "Chinese apples".  [[Datura]] is called 'thorn-apple".

[[ethnobotany|Ethnobotanical]] and [[ethnomycology|ethnomycological]] scholars such as [[R. Gordon Wasson]], [[Carl Ruck]] and [[Clark Heinrich]] write that the mythological apple is a symbolic substitution for the [[entheogen]]ic [[Amanita muscaria]] (or fly agaric) mushroom.  Its association with knowledge is an allusion to the revelatory states described by some shamans and users of psychedelic mushrooms.<ref>{{cite book

At times artists would co-opt the apple, as well as other [[Religious symbolism|religious symbology]], whether for ironic effect or as a stock element of symbolic vocabulary. Thus, secular art as well made use of the apple as [[symbol]] of love and sexuality. It is often an attribute associated with [[Venus (mythology)|Venus]] who is shown holding it.
