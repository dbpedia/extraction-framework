The '''''Buddhabrot''''' is a map related to the [[Mandelbrot set]]. Its name reflects its similarity to classical depictions of [[Gautama Buddha]], seated in a meditation pose with a forehead mark and traditional topknot.

==Discovery==

The ''Buddhabrot'' rendering technique was discovered and later described in a 1993 [[Usenet]] post to sci.fractals<ref name=sci/> by Melinda Green.<ref>Melinda Green [http://www.superliminal.com/fractals/bbrot/bbrot.htm The Buddhabrot Technique]</ref>

Previous researchers had come very close to finding the precise Buddhabrot technique. In 1988 Linas Vepstas relayed similar images to [[Cliff Pickover]] for inclusion in Pickover's forthcoming book ''Computers, Pattern, Chaos, and Beauty''. This led directly to the discovery of [[pickover stalks]]. These researchers did not filter out non-escaping trajectories required to produce the ghostly forms typically reminiscent of Hindu art.  Green first named it Ganesh, since an Indian co-worker "instantly recognized it as the god '[[Ganesha]]' which is the one with the head of an elephant."<ref name=sci>Daniel Green [http://groups.google.com/groups?hl=en&lr=&selm=18778%40autodesk.COM The deity hiding in the m-set]</ref>  The name ''Buddhabrot'' was coined later by [[Lori Gardi]].<ref name=wn>The University of Western Ontarioâ€™s newspaper [http://communications.uwo.ca/western_news/PDF/WNews_Dec04_08.pdf Chaos (theory) rules for software developer(PDF12MB)], p. 10</ref>

Mathematically, the Mandelbrot set consists of the [[Set (mathematics)|set]] of points ''c'' in the [[complex plane]] for which the [[iteration|iteratively]] defined [[sequence]]
