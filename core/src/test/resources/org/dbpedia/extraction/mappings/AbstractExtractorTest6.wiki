'''Voodoo Amplification''' is a [[Lansing, New York|Lansing]], [[New York]] company which designs and modifies guitar amplifiers.

==History==
[[Trace Allen Davis (businessman)|Trace Allen Davis]] first went into business in the mid 1990s with a small shop in Ithaca, New York, repairing and modifying production guitar amps with his own custom circuits. In time, his high-gain circuit mods became in such high demand by guitar players that production line amplifiers based on these custom circuits were released.

Voodoo Amps are hand-wired, point-to-point circuits. As such, their amps are often cited
among those brands of high-end guitar amplifiers termed "boutique" amplifiers. The company backs their commitment to outstanding tone with rock-solid customer service.

Noted users of Voodoo's production amps and circuit mods are (according to the manufacturer) include [[Vivian Campbell]] and [[Phil Collen]] (of [[Def Leppard]]), [[Doug Aldrich]] (of [[Whitesnake]]), [[Michael Wilton]] (of [[Queensryche]]), [[Kip Winger]], [[Jack Frost]], [[Richard Fortus]] (of [[Guns N' Roses]]), [[Buz McGrath]] and [[Ken Susi]] (of [[Unearth]]) and famed producer [[Michael Wagener]].

==Current Models==
Voodoo Amps currently produces a number of amplifiers which are a mix of modern- and vintage-inspiried designs.  Most models are known for their variation on Voodoo's high-gain circuits.
