{{nihongo|'''Akira Kurosawa'''|黒澤 明 or 黒沢 明|Kurosawa Akira|extra=March 23, 1910 – September 6, 1998}} was a [[Japanese people|Japanese]] [[film director]], [[film producer|producer]], [[screenwriter]] and [[film editing|editor]]. Regarded as one of the most important and influential filmmakers in the history of cinema, Kurosawa directed 30 films<ref group="note">In 1946, Kurosawa co-directed, with Hideo Sekigawa and Kajiro Yamamoto, the feature ''[[Those Who Make Tomorrow]]'' (''Asu o tsukuru hitobito''); apparently, he was commanded to make this film by [[Toho]] studios, to which he was under contract at the time. (He claimed that the film was shot in only a week.) It was the only film he ever directed for which he did not receive sole credit and the only one that has never been released on home video in any form. The movie was later repudiated by Kurosawa and is often not counted with the 30 other films he made, though it is listed in some filmographies of the director. See Galbraith, pp. 65–67, and Kurosawa's [[Internet Movie Database|IMDb]] page.</ref> in a career spanning 57 years.

Kurosawa entered the [[Japanese film]] industry in 1936, following a brief stint as a painter. After years of working on numerous films as an [[assistant director]] and scriptwriter, he made his debut as a director in 1943, during [[World War II]] with the popular [[action film]] ''[[Sanshiro Sugata]]'' (a.k.a. ''Judo Saga''). After the war, the critically acclaimed ''[[Drunken Angel]]'' (1948), in which Kurosawa cast then-unknown actor [[Toshirō Mifune]] in a starring role, cemented the director's reputation as one of the most important young filmmakers in Japan. The two men would go on to collaborate on another 15 films.

''[[Rashomon (film)|Rashomon]]'', which premiered in [[Tokyo]] in August [[1950 in film|1950]], and which also starred Mifune, became, on September 10, 1951, the surprise winner of the [[Golden Lion]] at the [[Venice Film Festival]] and was subsequently released in Europe and North America. The commercial and critical success of this film opened up Western film markets for the first time to the products of the Japanese film industry, which in turn led to international recognition for other Japanese film artists. Throughout the 1950s and early 1960s, Kurosawa directed approximately a film a year, including a number of highly regarded films such as ''[[Ikiru]]'' (1952), ''[[Seven Samurai]]'' (1954) and ''[[Yojimbo (film)|Yojimbo]]'' (1961). After the mid-1960s, he became much less prolific, but his later work—including his final two epics, ''[[Kagemusha]]'' (1980) and ''[[Ran (film)|Ran]]'' (1985)—continued to win awards, including the [[Palme d'Or]] for ''Kagemusha'', though more often abroad than in Japan.

In 1990, he accepted the [[Academy Award]] for [[Academy Honorary Award|Lifetime Achievement]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:pumHme2SFiQJ:aaspeechesdb.oscars.org/ics-wpd/url.ashx%3Fid%3D062-25%26qn%3DAAspeeches+Kurosawa+site:http://aaspeechesdb.oscars.org&cd=1&hl=en&ct=clnk&gl=us |title=Academy Award Acceptance Speech Database |accessdate=2010-06-13}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRiBBehTnZU |title=Akira Kurosawa Tribute with George Lucas, Steven Spielberg |date=2008-11-19 |accessdate=2010-06-28}}</ref> Posthumously, he was named "[[Asian of the Century]]" in the "Arts, Literature, and Culture" category by ''[[AsianWeek]]'' magazine and [[CNN]], cited as "one of the [five] people who contributed most to the betterment of Asia in the past 100 years".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www-cgi.cnn.com/ASIANOW/asiaweek/features/aoc/aoc.kurosawa.html|title=ASIANOW – Asiaweek – Asian of the Century – Kurosawa Akira – 12/10/99 |accessdate=2010-06-18}}</ref>

==Life and career==
===Childhood and youth (1910–1935)===
Kurosawa was born on 23 March 1910 in Ōimachi in the [[Ōmori]] district of [[Tokyo]]. His father Isamu, a member of a former [[samurai]] family from the [[Akita Prefecture]], worked as the director of the Army's Physical Education Institute's [[Secondary education in Japan#Middle school|lower secondary school]], while his mother Shima came from a merchant's family living in [[Osaka]]. Akira was the eighth and youngest child of the moderately wealthy family, with two of his siblings already grown up at the time of his birth and one deceased, leaving Kurosawa to grow up with three sisters and a brother.<ref>{{Harvnb|Galbraith|pp=14–15}}</ref><ref name="Kurosawa 1983 17">{{Harvnb|Kurosawa|1983|p=17}}</ref>

In addition to promoting physical exercise, Isamu Kurosawa was open to western traditions and saw theater and motion pictures as educationally valuable. He encouraged his children to watch films; young Akira viewed his first movies at the age of six.<ref>{{Harvnb|Kurosawa|1983|pp=5–7}}</ref> An important formative influence was his [[Elementary schools in Japan|elementary school]] teacher Mr Tachikawa, whose progressive educational practices ignited in his young pupil first a love of drawing and then an interest in education in general.<ref>{{Harvnb|Kurosawa|1983|pp=12–13}}</ref> During this time, the boy also studied [[calligraphy]] and [[Kendo]] swordsmanship.<ref>{{Harvnb|Galbraith|p=16}}</ref>

Another major childhood influence was Heigo Kurosawa, Akira's older brother by four years. In the aftermath of the [[1923 Great Kantō earthquake|Great Kantō earthquake]] of 1923, which devastated Tokyo, Heigo took the 13-year-old Akira to view the devastation. When the younger brother wanted to look away from the human corpses and animal carcasses scattered everywhere, Heigo forbade him to do so, instead encouraging Akira to face his fears by confronting them directly. Some commentators have suggested that this incident would influence Kurosawa's later artistic career, as the director was seldom hesitant to confront unpleasant truths in his work.<ref>{{Harvnb|Kurosawa|1983|pp=51–52}}</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Prince|p=302}}</ref>

Heigo was academically gifted, but soon after failing to secure a place in Tokyo's foremost [[Secondary education in Japan#Upper secondary school|high school]], he began to detach himself from the rest of the family, preferring to concentrate on his interest in foreign literature.<ref name="Kurosawa 1983 17"/> In the late 1920s, Heigo became a [[benshi]] (silent film narrator) for Tokyo theaters showing foreign films, and quickly made a name for himself. Akira, who at this point planned to become a painter,<ref>{{Harvnb|Kurosawa|1983|pp=70–71}}</ref> moved in with him, and the two brothers became inseparable.<ref name="Galbraith IV 2002 19">{{Harvnb|Galbraith|p=19}}</ref> Through Heigo, Akira devoured not only films but also theater and circus performances,<ref>{{Harvnb|Kurosawa|1983|pp=72–74, 82}}</ref> while exhibiting his paintings and working for the [[Left-wing politics|left-wing]] Proletarian Artists' League. However, he was never able to make a living with his art, and, as he began to perceive most of the proletarian movement as "putting unfulfilled political ideals directly onto the canvas," he lost his enthusiasm for painting.<ref>{{Harvnb|Kurosawa|1983|p=77}}</ref>
