This file describes the main steps necessary for creating a new DBpedia
release. It might not be complete. Please also consult with the others!


 - improve extraction framework by implementing ToDos
    - check also the bug tracker on SourceForge (http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=190976&atid=935520)

 - clean up the ontology and improve the (mappings on the wiki http://mappings.dbpedia.org/)

 - download Wikipedia XML dumps using ...dump.download.Download.scala
   - specify minimum number of articles a Wikipedia must have in order to be included
   
 - Use a defined state of the mappings wiki
   - Run maven launchers core/download-ontology and core/download-mappings
   - Commit the files to the hg repository
   - Don't change the files anymore. The whole extraction should use the same version.

 - for PlainAbstractExtractor: insert Wikipedia dumps into a local MySQL database using ...dump.sql.Import.scala
   - adjust the LocalSettings.php of mw-modified: specify username+password for the database and the database prefix
   TODO: more in-depth explanations about abstract extraction

 - extract datasets for all languages
   - run the MappingExtractor for all languages that have mappings on the wiki
   - consider starting the abstract extraction earlier (e.g. before cleaning up the mappings) because it takes quite long

 - test load part of http://wiki.dbpedia.org/DatasetsLoaded into an RDF store
   - especially new extended datasets (YAGO, Feebase etc.) to see whether there are syntax errors
   - browse through the data to make sure everything is there (e.g. using Pubby)

 - compress all dumps to .bz2 files using ...dump.compress.Compress.scala or the bash one-liner
   - compress OWL manually

 - run SVN/related_apps/downloadpagecreator/downloadpagecreator.php (configure variables at top of script beforehand)
   - paste the created code in http://wiki.dbpedia.org/Downloads
   - split the download page into multiple wiki pages. If the wiki code is too long for a sinlge page it gets truncated and produces rubbish web pages

 - pack all files specified on http://wiki.dbpedia.org/DatasetsLoaded / datasets-loaded.txt to OpenLink

 - pack all already compressed files into one archive ''all_languages.tar''

 - send:
   - all data specified on http://wiki.dbpedia.org/DatasetsLoaded zipped to OpenLink
   - all_languages.tar to Jens from Uni Leipzig

 - update http://wiki.dbpedia.org/
   - get some statistics for: classes, triples, mappings, ...

 - write the release notes

 - check if all example links on http://wiki.dbpedia.org/ are still working with the new end point

 - update Wikipedia article
